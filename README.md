Tire Condition Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

An end-to-end **deep learning–based image classification system** for detecting tire conditions from images.
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained with TensorFlow/Keras and is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

The system classifies tire images into **three categories**:

* **Flat**
* **Full**
* **No-Tire**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Tire condition plays a crucial role in vehicle safety. Manual inspection is time-consuming and inconsistent, while sensor-based solutions require additional hardware.
This project proposes an **image-based solution** using deep learning to automatically classify tire conditions from RGB images.

**Key highlights:**

* CNN-based image classification
* Data augmentation for better generalization
* Softmax-based decision with confidence score
* Deployed as a Streamlit web application

---

## 🧠 Model & Methodology

### Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:

* 3 convolutional blocks with increasing filters (32 → 64 → 128)
* Max pooling layers for spatial downsampling
* Fully connected layer with dropout regularization
* Softmax output layer for multi-class classification

**Total parameters:** ~12.9 million

### Training Setup

* Image size: **240 × 240**
* Optimizer: **Adam**
* Loss function: **Categorical Cross-Entropy**
* Epochs: **10**
* Train / Validation split: **80% / 20%**

### Decision Rule

The model outputs class probabilities using **Softmax**:


The confidence score is the highest softmax probability.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd DL_AOL
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Using Conda**

```bash
conda create -n tire_cnn python=3.9 -y
conda activate tire_cnn
```

**OR using venv**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Verify Configuration

Make sure `config/config.yaml` is correctly set:

```yaml
img_size: 240
batch_size: 32
epochs: 10
num_classes: 3

data_dir: "data/raw"
model_path: "outputs/models/tire_cnn.h5"

class_names:
  - flat
  - full
  - no-tire
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Streamlit App

⚠️ **Run this command from the project root (`DL_AOL`)**

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8501
```
